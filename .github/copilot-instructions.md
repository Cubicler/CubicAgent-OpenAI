## üéØ Core Services

### OpenAIService
**Purpose:** Handle OpenAI API and iterative function calling
**Required Behavior:**
- Execute session loop with `DISPATCH_SESSION_MAX_ITERATION` limit
- Use CubicAgent.getTools() to fetch available Cubicler tools
- Convert Cubicler tools to OpenAI function schemas
- Maintain conversation context including tool calls/results
- Stop when OpenAI returns final response (no tool calls)
- Handle MCP retry through CubicAgentKit

### MessageBuilder
**Purpose:** Convert between Cubicler and OpenAI message formats
**Required Behavior:**
- Convert AgentRequest.messages to OpenAI format
- Include iteration context in system messages
- Preserve conversation including assistant tool_calls
- Clean final responses (remove agent name prefixes)

## üîß Session Iteration Pattern

1. **Initialize** - Set up iteration counter and context
2. **Get tools** - Fetch via CubicAgent.getTools()
3. **OpenAI request** - Send with function definitions
4. **Tool execution** - Execute if OpenAI requests tools
5. **Iteration check** - Continue or return final response
6. **Cleanup** - Log metrics

## ‚úÖ Your Role

**MAINTAIN:**
- CubicAgentKit 2.3.1 patterns with lazy initialization
- Iterative function calling loop with tool building
- Message conversion and response cleaning
- 16 environment variables as specified
- Error handling and retry patterns
- Dual usage (standalone + library)
- Memory integration patterns with internal tools
- SOLID principles and clean code standards

**DO NOT:**
- Add environment variables beyond the 16 specified
- Implement complex health checks or monitoring
- Add authentication middleware
- Over-engineer session management
- Add manual initialization code
- Implement streaming responses

# Global Development Standards & Best Practices

> **Author Preferences:** These are my personal coding standards and preferences that should be followed across all projects, regardless of programming language.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

Write code that is clean, maintainable, testable, and scalable. Always prioritize code readability and long-term maintainability over short-term convenience. Prefer simple, focused code over complex abstractions - it's better to have code that does one thing well than code that tries to be reusable for everything.

## üìê SOLID Principles (Universal)

Always follow SOLID principles when writing code:

‚Ä¢ **Single Responsibility Principle** - Each class/function/module should have one reason to change
‚Ä¢ **Open/Closed Principle** - Open for extension, closed for modification
‚Ä¢ **Liskov Substitution Principle** - Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
‚Ä¢ **Interface Segregation Principle** - Many specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
‚Ä¢ **Dependency Inversion Principle** - Depend on abstractions, not concretions

## üõ†Ô∏è Method & Function Design

### Method Length & Complexity
‚Ä¢ Break down long methods/functions into smaller, focused units that each handle a specific responsibility
‚Ä¢ Avoid redundant wrapper methods that only call one private method without additional logic
‚Ä¢ Single responsibility per method - each method should do one thing well
‚Ä¢ Meaningful names that clearly describe what the method does

### Parameters & Return Values
‚Ä¢ Limit parameters - if you need more than 3-4 parameters, consider using a configuration object/struct
‚Ä¢ Consistent return types - avoid functions that sometimes return different types
‚Ä¢ Fail fast - validate inputs early and throw meaningful errors

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Principles

### Modularity & Separation of Concerns
‚Ä¢ Service-oriented design with clear separation of responsibilities
‚Ä¢ Dependency injection for testability and flexibility
‚Ä¢ Interface/contract-based programming - depend on abstractions, not implementations
‚Ä¢ Avoid monolithic classes/modules - break them into focused, cohesive units

### Error Handling
‚Ä¢ Throw errors, don't catch and ignore - let errors bubble up unless they are expected and recoverable
‚Ä¢ Fail fast - validate inputs early and throw meaningful errors immediately
‚Ä¢ Consistent error handling patterns across the entire codebase
‚Ä¢ Meaningful error messages that help developers understand what went wrong and how to fix it
‚Ä¢ Log at appropriate levels with context and structured data
‚Ä¢ Only catch errors you can handle - if you can't recover or provide meaningful handling, let it throw
‚Ä¢ Expected errors should be handled gracefully - but unexpected errors should surface quickly

## üìù Code Quality Standards

### Naming Conventions
‚Ä¢ Descriptive names - code should be self-documenting
‚Ä¢ Consistent naming patterns within each project/language
‚Ä¢ Avoid abbreviations unless they're industry standard
‚Ä¢ Boolean variables/functions should be clearly boolean (is/has/can/should prefixes)

### Comments & Documentation
‚Ä¢ Code should be self-documenting - prefer clear code over comments
‚Ä¢ Document the "why", not the "what" - explain business logic and decisions
‚Ä¢ Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
‚Ä¢ API documentation for all public interfaces

### Testing Philosophy
‚Ä¢ Write testable code - design with testing in mind
‚Ä¢ Unit tests for business logic - test behavior, not implementation
‚Ä¢ Integration tests for workflows - test how components work together
‚Ä¢ Test edge cases and error conditions

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Refactoring
‚Ä¢ Continuous refactoring - improve code quality incrementally
‚Ä¢ Test before and after refactoring to ensure behavior is preserved
‚Ä¢ Remove dead code - don't leave commented-out code
‚Ä¢ DRY principle with wisdom - Don't Repeat Yourself, but avoid premature abstraction and forced reuse
‚Ä¢ Prefer simple duplication over complex abstraction - if reuse makes code complicated, duplicate and keep it simple
‚Ä¢ One thing well - better to have multiple simple functions than one complex reusable one

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

### Optimization Philosophy
‚Ä¢ Measure before optimizing - profile and identify actual bottlenecks
‚Ä¢ Readability first, optimize later - don't sacrifice clarity for micro-optimizations
‚Ä¢ Cache appropriately - but avoid premature caching
‚Ä¢ Consider scalability from the design phase

### Resource Management
‚Ä¢ Clean up resources - close files, connections, release memory appropriately
‚Ä¢ Efficient algorithms - choose appropriate data structures and algorithms
‚Ä¢ Lazy loading where appropriate to improve startup time

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Input Validation
‚Ä¢ Validate all inputs at system boundaries
‚Ä¢ Sanitize data before processing or storage
‚Ä¢ Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
‚Ä¢ Implement proper authentication and authorization

### Data Protection
‚Ä¢ Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, personal info)
‚Ä¢ Use environment variables for configuration and secrets
‚Ä¢ Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
‚Ä¢ Follow principle of least privilege

## üîß Linting and Code Quality Rules

When fixing linting issues or working with code quality tools:

- **If the linter is wrong** (like when they said something unused, but it's actually used) just disable the linter on that particular warning or error with explanatory comments
- **If you need to add an import**, add it to the top of the file with other imports
- **Import that are allowed in middle of the file** are only the imports used for singleton instances (at the bottom of service files)
- **Always use proper TypeScript types** instead of `any` - create new type definitions when needed
- **For constructor parameters flagged as unused** but are actually used as dependency injection, use `// eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars` 
- **For safe non-null assertions** where you've verified the value exists, use `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion -- Safe: reason`
- **Remove truly unused imports** rather than disabling the warning
- **Fix formatting issues** automatically with `--fix` flag when possible

## ‚úÖ Your Role as a Developer/AI Assistant

When working on any codebase, your job is to:

‚Ä¢ Follow these global standards while adapting to language-specific conventions
‚Ä¢ Write clean, maintainable code that other developers can easily understand and modify
‚Ä¢ Think about long-term maintainability - code is read more often than it's written
‚Ä¢ Design for extensibility - anticipate future changes and requirements
‚Ä¢ Prioritize code quality over speed of delivery
‚Ä¢ Ask questions when requirements are unclear rather than making assumptions
‚Ä¢ Implement exactly what is requested - don't add features or functionality that wasn't asked for
‚Ä¢ Consider the bigger picture - how does this code fit into the overall system?
‚Ä¢ Be consistent with existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
‚Ä¢ Document decisions that might not be obvious to future developers
‚Ä¢ Test your code and consider edge cases

## ‚ùå DO NOT

‚Ä¢ Do not sacrifice code quality for quick fixes or tight deadlines
‚Ä¢ Do not write monolithic functions/classes - break them down into manageable pieces
‚Ä¢ Do not ignore error handling - always consider what can go wrong and let errors surface
‚Ä¢ Do not catch and swallow exceptions - only catch errors you can meaningfully handle or recover from
‚Ä¢ Do not hide failures - if something fails, it should be visible and actionable
‚Ä¢ Do not hardcode values - use configuration files or constants
‚Ä¢ Do not copy-paste code without understanding what it does
‚Ä¢ Do not leave TODO comments in production code without tracking them
‚Ä¢ Do not commit commented-out code - use version control instead
‚Ä¢ Do not ignore linting/formatting tools - consistency matters
‚Ä¢ Do not skip documentation for public APIs and complex business logic
‚Ä¢ Do not make breaking changes without proper versioning and migration paths
‚Ä¢ Do not optimize prematurely - measure first, then optimize
‚Ä¢ Do not force code reuse - avoid creating complicated abstractions just to eliminate duplication
‚Ä¢ Do not create "Swiss Army knife" functions - functions that try to do everything for everyone
‚Ä¢ Do not sacrifice simplicity for reusability - simple, testable code is better than complex reusable code
‚Ä¢ Do not reinvent the wheel - use established libraries and patterns when appropriate, but don't force custom reuse
‚Ä¢ Do not ignore security considerations - think about potential vulnerabilities
‚Ä¢ Do not add unrequested features - implement exactly what is asked for, nothing more
‚Ä¢ Do not make assumptions about data or user behavior - validate everything
‚Ä¢ Do not implement "nice to have" features without explicit request - stick to requirements

## üéØ Language-Specific Notes

While these principles apply universally, remember to:

‚Ä¢ Follow language idioms and established conventions
‚Ä¢ Use language-specific tools for testing, linting, and formatting
‚Ä¢ Leverage language strengths - don't fight the language design
‚Ä¢ Stay updated with language best practices and evolving standards
‚Ä¢ Use appropriate design patterns for the specific language/framework

## üìã Quick Checklist

Before considering any piece of code "done":

- [ ] Does it follow SOLID principles?
- [ ] Is each method/function focused on a single responsibility?
- [ ] Are names descriptive and consistent?
- [ ] Is error handling appropriate and consistent?
- [ ] Is it testable and tested?
- [ ] Is it documented where necessary?
- [ ] Does it follow project conventions?
- [ ] Is it secure and performant enough?
- [ ] Will it be maintainable in 6 months?

These standards are living guidelines that should evolve with experience and changing best practices. The goal is to write code that is a joy to work with, both now and in the future.
